# CS 3511: Algorithms Honors, Spring 2018
This repository contains homeworks I created and curated as Head TA for CS 3511,
an undergraduate honors class on Algorithms at Georgia Tech, during Spring 2018.

If you're an instructor or a TA of an algorithms class, feel free to use them
for your classes! I only ask that you don't create a public repository of your
solutions to these homeworks, in order to make this repository an effective
teaching resource. If you'd like to know the solutions to any of the problems,
please contact me.
