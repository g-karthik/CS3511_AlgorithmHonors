# CS3511_AlgorithmHonors
This repository contains home-works I created and curated as Head TA for CS 3511,
an undergraduate honors class on Algorithms at Georgia Tech, during Spring 2018.

If you're an instructor or a TA of an algorithms class, feel free to use them
for your classes! I only ask that you don't create a public repository of your
solutions to these home-works, in order to make this repository an effective
teaching resource. If you'd like to know the solutions to any of the problems,
please contact me.
